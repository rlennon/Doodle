## Introduction

This is the online repository for the engineering and tech giant **Doodle**. Our current product **Brancher** will be delivered using an Agile methodology that embraces the [DevOps culture](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html).
Please note that our culture embraces change and these documents are treated as living, breathing artefacts that will be continuously updated.
