## Open Source Software (OSS) Best practice

##1. Documenting our processes
We done this very well. We have written documentation on all our processes, software and risks. This helped everyone understand code a bit better or help people with installing certain tools and seeing what risks they may need to look out for. Writing things in documentation makes it easier to say no when something doesn’t fit into our scope for the project. It also makes it easier for people to pitch in and help if someone is having trouble or got something wrong. All of our documentaion is up to date.

We are also documentating our converstations on slack and blackboard, so it can be reviewed later if needs be.

##2. Learning how to say no
There was not really much of this. We were given criteria on a sheet and any inconsistencies we discussed with our PO. During these talks with PO, we would have discussions about certain topics/criteria or any extra feature requests and we had to learn to say no. 

We also had to learn how to say no when dealing with pull requests on github. We could not just allow every PR request to be approved. A PR request need 2 reviewers before a PR was approved. A lot of PR requests were denied or were told to change something to make it better. We also learned to say no to people on bamboo when we were having our scrum meetings. People gave their views and were told no in a friendly manner etc.

To reduce the volume of unwanted contributions, We explain our project process for submitting and accepting contributions in our github documentation and on our first scrum meeting. We also used Jira to help with contributions as the team could see everyones contribution and we could tell that the story/epic is not relevant etc.

This made us proactive team. This is good as it reduces the chance that someone will put in many wasted hours of work into a pull request that you aren’t going to accept. And it made our workload easier to manage.

##3. Leverage your community
During this project nobody had to do any work themselves. We have a very good team with many people that are excellent at Developement, Operations or a bit of both. If anyone was stuck on something, they would just simply message the group chat or tell us on blackboard and advice or a hand would be given. If someone could not write code, a team member would jump in to teach and help them on how to do it.
