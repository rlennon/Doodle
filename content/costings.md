# Costings

## Overview

This is an outline of the costings for this project. These costings can be used as an indicator only as the project is run on a voluntary / part-time basis.

### Infrastructure Cost

The infrastructure being used to host our services cannot be costed at this time as it is shared and provided free of charge from LYIT.

If this were a cloud based project this cost could be easily calculated.
