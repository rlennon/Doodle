# Scrum

At the start of the project the Doodle team decided to use an Agile approach to the project.

Agile is an approach to software development where the team members work closely with the Product Owner (Ruth Lennon) to come up with the tasks required to deliver the project.

Time working on an Agile project is split into sprints and the team decided to make sprints last for 1 week which ran from Friday morning to Thursday evening.

At the first sprint planning session the team came up with as many tasks as possible that they felt were needed to deliver the product.

In order to ensure no tasks were forgotten about, each task needed to be tracked. There are a number of useful tools for this, the Product Owner decided that the team should use Jira so each member of the team was granted access to Jira.

The tasks were added as stories under the Doodle board within Jira (https://studentjira.lyit.ie/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=DOODLE&rapidView=51&view=planning.nodetail).

Not all tasks were created at this time, additional tasks were created as the project progressed.

Epics within Jira are groupings of tasks that revolve around one specific area and the team created a number of Epics, some examples are Documentation, Jenkins Pipeline, Unit Testing and Sonar. Each story created by the team was assigned to an Epic.

At the first planning session 3 major roles were decided upon which rotated amongst the team members each week. The roles were Scrum Master, Proxy PO and Technical Lead.

A Scrum Master within the Doodle group has the following responsibilities:

- Setting up any meetings that are required.
- Attempts to resolve impediments that the team may have, though it would be better if the team were able to resolve impediments themselves.
- Works with the PO and/or proxy PO on requirements.
- Gets each member of the team to give updates at the twice weekly stand up, either in person or through Slack.
- Points raised in the sprint retro will be noted and posted on the Doodle slack retro channel
- Keeps an eye on Jira to ensure tasks are being updated and team members have the correct amount of work in each sprint.
- Closing the previous sprint, starting the current sprint & filling in the sprint goal in Jira.

A Proxy PO within the Doodle group will handle any PO related tasks in the event of the PO being unable to attend a meeting. The proxy PO will then inform the PO of the tasks that were performed in their absence.

A Tech Lead within the Doodle group is responsible for making any technology related decisions during the sprint then informing the whole team of the decisions & the reasons behind those decisions.

Story Points are estimates within Jira as to how long a task will take, the team came up with the following definition of how the team members should assign points to each task.

1 = Up to 1 day to complete

2 = From 1 day to 2.5 days to complete

5 = From 2.5 to 1 week to complete

8 = From 1 week to 2 weeks to complete (needs to be broken into at least 2 stories)

13 = Multiple weeks to complete (needs to be broken into at least 3 stories)

During planning sessions, which took place each Thursday at 8pm Irish time, tasks that the team wanted to work on for the upcoming sprint were discussed, assigned a story point and moved into the upcoming sprint in Jira. A deciding factor on what the team worked on for each sprint was which tasks from the previous sprint were not completed as that could have an impact on moving forward, depending on what the carryover tasks were.

On Friday morning, the scrum master for the sprint that was just starting, went into Jira and started the new sprint, closed the previous sprint and moved any tasks within the previous sprint that were still open into either the Backlog or into the new sprint. When starting the new sprint the scrum master gave each sprint a goal, the teams decided what these goals would be at their first planning session. The goals were:

**Sprint 1 - Define Process**

**Sprint 2 - Jira / Planning**

**Sprint 3 - Proof Of Concept work / Technology / Architecture**

**Sprint 4 - Set up environments**

**Sprint 5 - Set up Jenkins pipelines**

**Sprint 6 - Set up automation**

**Sprint 7 - Refine product**

Task progress within each sprint are communicated to the team during stand up meetings, the team decided to hold two stand ups each sprint. These took place on Monday nights after that days class and on Friday mornings after that days class.

Each person present at the stand up provided updates, they were in the form:

**What I worked on**

**What I plan to work on**

**Any Impediments**

If possible the Scrum Master can help resolve impediments however really the team should work to resolve these issues themselves.

The team held a few retrospectives during the project, these were meetings where the team members discussed what worked and didn't work in the project since the previous retrospective. All items mentioned were grouped under the headings:

**Stop Doing**

**Keep Doing**

**Improvements**

Originally these points were posted on a Slack channel called doodle_retro however this never kept going so the items were uploaded to GitHub instead (https://github.com/rlennon/Doodle/blob/master/content/projectlog.md)

BlackBoard and Hangouts are team collaboration tools which allow voice and video meetings to be held. Originally we held meetings using BlackBoard and were informed to record them however we were never given recording ability within BlackBoard. A number of members of the team had issues using BlackBoard so a decision was made to use Hangouts instead. Hangouts worked a lot better for the team however we never actually recorded any of the meetings. This is something for the team to work on in the future.
